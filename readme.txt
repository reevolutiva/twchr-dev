Manage and integrate your Twitch.tv channel from WordPress Admin with <a href="https://twitcher.pro/" title="">Twitcher.pro</a>. Promote future streamings and embed past streamings from Twitch or Youtube.

== Description ==
Easily *integrate your Twitch channel* to WordPress with <a href="https://twitcher.pro/" title="">Twitcher.pro</a>. 
Twitcher helps you to program and manage your streamings in an easy way in 3 simple steps:
1. *Program your future streamings and series from WordPress*: 
    Twitcher.pro creates a landing page for every future streaming and synchronizes with the Twitch.tv Calendar. 
    Create series for every recurrent streaming and automatically create and archive pages for each one.

2. Go *Live*: 
    Transmit your live stream as always. <a href="https://twitcher.pro/" title="">Twitcher.pro</a> will show your 
    live streaming on your Streaming Landing Page.

3. *Import and Embed* your past streaming to your Streaming Landing Page: 
    Embed your past streaming directly from Twitch. 
    <a href="https://twitcher.pro/" title="">Twitcher.pro</a> will show your actual list of Twitch videos. Assign a past VOD from Twitch or Youtube.

Of course, you can customize any part of your site with shortcodes. <a href="https://twitcher.pro/twitcher-shortcodes/" title="">More Info here</a>

Our main goal is to create a tool and a method for streamers that helps them grow their community and monetization, integrating the management, programming, 
and integration of a commercial strategy to sell any WooCommerce product, course, digital event, or any product or service.
